Installing Percona Toolkit
==========================

System Requirements
-------------------

Most tools require:

   * Perl v5.8 or newer
   * Bash v3 or newer
   * Core Perl modules like Time::HiRes

Tools that connect to MySQL require:

   * Perl modules DBI and DBD::mysql
   * MySQL 5.0 or newer

Percona Toolkit is only tested on UNIX systems, primarily Debian and
Red Hat derivatives; other operating systems are not supported.

Tools that connect to MySQL may work with MySQL v4.1, but this is not
test or supported.

Quick Install
-------------

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Detailed Install
----------------

Extract the tarball and cd to the resulting directory:

   tar zxvf percona-toolkit-<version>.tar.gz
   cd percona-toolkit-<version>

Generate the Makefile, which will check Perl module dependencies and
so forth:

   perl Makefile.PL

Build the tools' man pages and prep for test and install:

   make

Test that the tools can run:

   make test

All tests should pass.  If not, then your system may be missing a Perl module
required by a tool.  The tests are not comprehensive; they only test that the
tools can be executed by Perl and Bash.

Finally, install all tools and their man pages:

   make install

On most systems, the tools are installed in /usr/local/bin.

Installation Options
--------------------

To install to a directory other than your system's default, such as your
home directory, generate the Makefile with a prefix:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=${HOME}
