080816  7:53:17 [ERROR] Cannot find table
exampledb/exampletable from the internal data dictionary
of InnoDB though the .frm file for the table exists. Maybe you
have deleted and recreated InnoDB data files but have forgotten
to delete the corresponding .frm files of InnoDB tables, or you
have moved .frm files to another database?
See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-troubleshooting.html
how you can resolve the problem.
