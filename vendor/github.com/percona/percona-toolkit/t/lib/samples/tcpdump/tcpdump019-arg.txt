insert into t values ('NEW YORK \(Reuters\) - U.S. government bonds fell while stocks extended gains on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said in a statement will gradually slow its pace of buying government debt as the economy was levelling out. The Fed finished a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, and left benchmark interest rates near zero. The Fed also extended the duration but not the size of its program to buy U.S. $300 bln (182 billion pounds) of U.S. Treasuries. "The fact that they are extending the timetable, but not the amount of Treasury purchases shows that they are seeing some of the signs of the recovery that they\'re trying to create, and want to let the earlier purchases season," said Daniel Penrod, senior industry analyst at California Credit Union League in Ontario, California. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell after the statement as bond dealers were disappointed the Fed did not increase the amount of debt it plans to buy. The benchmark ended down 11/32, with the yield at 3.72 percent. The Fed launched the debt buying program in March when it had already chopped interest rates to near zero but wanted to open the money taps even wider to support the struggling economy. The Fed\'s Treasury purchases were previously scheduled to expire in September. U.S. stocks continued to rise after the Fed said the economy was showing signs of levelling out after 20 months of recession. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 1.30 percent, The Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index <.SPX> ended up 1.15 percent and The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> finished up 1.47 percent. "Validating what the economic data as late has shown, the Fed essentially signalled to the market that this recession is over by changing its tone from contraction to levelling out," said Burt White, Chief Investment Officer at LPL Financial in Boston.
